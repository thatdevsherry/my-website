# Two-way Active Measurement Protocol

TWAMP ([RFC 5357](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc5357/)) is a protocol for analysing networking details between two devices.

It is aimed as a better alternative to existing tools like `ping`, `traceroute` etc.

It achieves so by having a server-client architecture which allows it to analyse data both ways.
